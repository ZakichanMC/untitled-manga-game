# [ARCHIVED] untitled-comic-game
THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED.

Drag different panels into a page grid to make the comic of your dreams!

...is what was supposed to happen. But it didn't. I was stuck between game design decisions and after ruminating for a long time, ultimately decided to throw in the towel and move on.

Making games is hard. Making games without a clear direction is even harder. I see this not as a failure, but as a lesson. A lesson I can take with me for the rest of my gamedev journey.

It's important to understand how you learn and how you work. I work well with a clear vision, and Untitled Comic Game lacked that.

In the game you can drag different panels into a grid, and select up to 2 of 6 items that synergize with each other to try and achieve high scores. Good luck figuring out what they do though because there's no UI or menus. Alse, each grid size has a theoretical score limit, and the point values are not balanced at all. So it isn't much, but it can be called a "game" at the very least.

Thanks for reading, and happy gamedev-ing.
